## ðŸ›  Development Workflow from PRD

### 1. **PRD â†’ Planning**

- **Inputs:** Product Requirement Document (goals, user stories, success metrics, constraints).
- **Outputs:**

  - Clarifications with product owner/PM.
  - Break PRD into **Epics** and **User Stories**.
  - Define acceptance criteria (DoD).
  - Prioritize backlog.

ðŸ‘‰ Tools: Notion, Confluence, Jira, Linear.

---

### 2. **Design & Architecture**

- **UI/UX Design**

  - Convert PRD â†’ wireframes â†’ high-fidelity designs.
  - Validate with stakeholders.

- **Tech Architecture**

  - Decide system design, APIs, database schema, infrastructure (cloud, containerization).
  - Document architecture diagrams.

ðŸ‘‰ Tools: Figma, Miro, Whimsical, Excalidraw, PlantUML.

---

### 3. **Task Breakdown & Estimation**

- Split Epics â†’ Stories â†’ Tasks.
- Estimate effort (story points, hours).
- Identify dependencies & risks.
- Assign responsibilities.

ðŸ‘‰ Agile ceremonies: Sprint Planning.

---

### 4. **Implementation**

- Create feature branch (`feature/<ticket-id>-description`).
- Write code following coding standards.
- Unit tests included.
- Commit often, push to remote.

ðŸ‘‰ Tools: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

---

### 5. **Code Review & Pull Request**

- Open PR (linked to Jira/issue).
- Automated checks run:

  - Lint, Type checking
  - Unit tests
  - Security scan

- Reviewer checks:

  - Code correctness
  - Readability
  - Alignment with PRD & design

ðŸ‘‰ Best practice: small PRs, <300 lines.

---

### 6. **CI/CD Pipeline**

- PR merged â†’ triggers CI:

  - Build
  - Tests (unit, integration, e2e if possible)
  - Static analysis

- If passes â†’ deploy to **Staging**.

ðŸ‘‰ Tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, ArgoCD.

---

### 7. **QA & Verification**

- QA tests against **acceptance criteria** in PRD:

  - Functional tests
  - Regression tests
  - Cross-browser/device testing

- Bug reports â†’ back to dev cycle.

---

### 8. **Stakeholder UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**

- Business/product team verifies features match PRD.
- If approved â†’ mark ready for release.

---

### 9. **Release & Deployment**

- Merge to `main` â†’ CD deploys to Production.
- Announce release (Slack, Changelog, Release Notes).
- Monitor errors/logs.

ðŸ‘‰ Tools: Sentry, Datadog, Grafana.

---

### 10. **Post-Release**

- Collect feedback & metrics (does it meet PRD success metrics?).
- Bug fixes / improvements go back into backlog.
- Write learnings â†’ next iteration.

PRD â†’ Planning â†’ Design â†’ Breakdown â†’ Implementation â†’ PR â†’ CI/CD â†’ QA â†’ UAT â†’ Release â†’ Monitoring â†’ Feedback
